# Probability-Distribution
Probability Distributions in Data Science: Explore essential probability concepts, discrete &amp; continuous distributions, hypothesis testing, Bayesian stats, ML applications, and simulations. An extensive resource for data scientists and learners.

Creating a comprehensive GitHub repository that covers various probability distributions and their applications in data science would be an extensive project. Below is a generalized structure for such a repository:

1. **README.md**: An overview of the repository, describing its purpose, and providing a table of contents for the included notebooks/scripts.

2. **Introduction to Probability**:
   - Basic Concepts (Sample Space, Events, Probability Axioms)
   - Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem
   - Independence and Joint Probability

3. **Discrete Probability Distributions**:
   - Bernoulli Distribution
   - Binomial Distribution
   - Poisson Distribution
   - Geometric Distribution
   - Negative Binomial Distribution
   - Hypergeometric Distribution

4. **Continuous Probability Distributions**:
   - Uniform Distribution
   - Normal Distribution
   - Exponential Distribution
   - Gamma Distribution
   - Beta Distribution
   - Weibull Distribution
   - Log-Normal Distribution

5. **Multivariate Probability Distributions**:
   - Joint Distributions
   - Marginal and Conditional Distributions
   - Covariance and Correlation

6. **Sampling Distributions**:
   - Central Limit Theorem
   - Sampling from Populations

7. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - One-sample and Two-sample Tests
   - Chi-Square Test
   - ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

8. **Bayesian Statistics**:
   - Bayesian Inference
   - Bayesian Estimation
   - Bayesian Networks

9. **Probability in Machine Learning**:
   - Probability in Decision Making (e.g., Decision Trees)
   - Naive Bayes Classifier
   - Gaussian Mixture Models

10. **Time Series and Stochastic Processes**:
   - Autoregressive (AR) Models
   - Moving Average (MA) Models
   - ARMA and ARIMA Models
   - Markov Chains

11. **Statistical Simulations**:
   - Monte Carlo Simulation
   - Bootstrapping

12. **Data Science Projects with Probability**:
   - A directory to include data science projects that demonstrate the practical applications of probability distributions.

13. **resources.md**: A list of external resources, books, courses, and tutorials related to probability and its applications in data science.

14. **LICENSE**: Choose an appropriate license for your repository.
